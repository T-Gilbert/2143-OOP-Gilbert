## Definitions

#### Abstraction

> The process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world

- There are two types of abstraction: Data & Process

- Data Abstraction - When the object data is not visible to the outer world, it creates data abstraction. If needed, access to the Objects’ data is provided through various different methods

- Process Abstration - When we don’t need to provide details about all the functions of an object, and we hide the internal implementation of the different functions involved in a user operation, it creates process abstraction

#### Attributes / Properties

> An attribute denotes a part of an aggregate object, and so is used during analysis as well as design to express a singular property of the class 

#### Class

> A user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods

#### Class Variable

> An attribute defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist. All instances of that class share its value as well as its declaration.

#### Composition

> A concept in OOP that models the relationship between two classes. It involves using other classes to build more complex classes, and there is no parent/child relationship.

- Represents a "has-a" relationship

- There are two types of composition: Association and Aggregation.

- Association - You usually see the parts that build the whole object

- Aggregation - Typically, you only see the object as a whole

#### Constructor

> A special method of a class or structure that initializes a newly created object of that type

- Whenever an object is created, the constructor is called automatically

- Although it resembles it, a constructor is not a proper method since it doesn’t have a return type

#### Encapsulation

> The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit

- Makes testing systems more efficient & easier

#### Friends

> A function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data

- Declared by the class that is granting access, so friend functions are part of the class interface (like methods)

#### Inheritance

> A mechanism in which you can derive a class from another class, creating a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods

- Weakens encapsulation, so may not be appropriate for applications where higher protection is required
