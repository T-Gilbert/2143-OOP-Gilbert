## Definitions

#### Abstraction

> The process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world

- There are two types of abstraction: Data & Process

- Data Abstraction - When the object data is not visible to the outer world, it creates data abstraction. If needed, access to the Objects’ data is provided through various different methods

- Process Abstration - When we don’t need to provide details about all the functions of an object, and we hide the internal implementation of the different functions involved in a user operation, it creates process abstraction

#### Attributes / Properties

> An attribute denotes a part of an aggregate object, and so is used during analysis as well as design to express a singular property of the class 

#### Class

> A user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods
